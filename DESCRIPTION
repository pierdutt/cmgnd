Description: The 'cmgnd' implements the constrained mixture of generalized normal distributions model, a flexible statistical framework for modelling univariate data exhibiting non-normal features such as skewness, multi-modality, and heavy tails. By imposing constraints on model parameters, the 'cmgnd' reduces estimation complexity while maintaining high descriptive power, offering an efficient solution in the presence of distributional irregularities.
