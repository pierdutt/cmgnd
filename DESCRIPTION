Description: The constrained mixture of generalized normal distributions (CMGND) model is an advanced statistical tool for analyzing univariate data with non-normal features, such as asymmetry, multi-modality, leptokurtosis, and heavy tails. The CMGND model introduces constrained parameters, reducing the number of parameters that need estimation and enhancing model performance.
