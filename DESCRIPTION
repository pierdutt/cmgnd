Description: The constrained mixture of generalized normal 
    distributions (cmgnd) model is an advanced statistical 
    tool for analyzing univariate data with non-normal features, 
    such as asymmetry, multi-modality, and heavy tails. 
    The cmgnd model introduces constrained parameters, 
    reducing the number of parameters that need estimation and 
    enhancing model performance.
